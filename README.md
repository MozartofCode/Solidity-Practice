# Solidity-Practice

Practicing some of the concepts I learned in the "Building Dapps in Ethereum Blockchain" course from Coursera
Specifically, I practice how to write smart contracts using Solidity and the Truffle Framework, deploy them using Ganache and
interact with them using the web3.js library in JavaScript.

I also experiment with Remix IDE for developing smart contracts as well.
