# Solidity-Practice

Practicing some of the concepts I learned in the "Building Dapps in Ethereum Blockchain" course from Coursera
Specifically, I practice how to write smart contracts using Solidity and the Truffle Framework and deploy them using Ganache.

I also experiment with Remix IDE for developing smart contracts as well.
